One of the foundational architectural goals of **Minrock** is to eliminate the friction between private note-taking in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and public publishing on the web.

Instead of dealing with proprietary headless CMS services, cloud databases, or slow web dashboards, Minrock treats your local Markdown repository as the single source of truth. By combining Minrock with [Vault CMS](https://vaultcms.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms)), your `src/content/` directory transforms into a dedicated desktop publishing studio.

## Which Path Should You Follow?

Depending on your goals and familiarity with Obsidian, choose the path that best suits you:

> [!TIP] Path 1 (Recommended / Plug & Play)
> Minrock **already comes with the `.obsidian/` folder pre-configured** inside `src/content/`. If you simply want to write posts and publish them without any setup, you don't need to follow this manual tutorial!
> 
> Simply open the `src/content` folder in Obsidian and press `Ctrl + N`.
> 👉 **[Follow the Quickstart Guide (Getting Started) →](/blog/getting-started-with-minrock)**

> [!NOTE] Path 2 (Manual / From Scratch with Wizard)
> If you want to understand the under-the-hood architecture, are setting up Vault CMS from scratch on an existing Astro project via `npx create-vaultcms`, or need to re-run the graphical setup wizard following David Kimball's video, read the step-by-step technical guide below.

---

## Step 1: Running the Command-Line Installer

In the root directory of your Minrock project, execute the official Vault CMS installer:

```bash
npx create-vaultcms
```

This command inspects your workspace and installs the curated suite of Obsidian community plugins inside `src/content/.obsidian/`.

---

## Step 2: Opening the Vault in Obsidian

Launch Obsidian on your computer:
1. Click **"Open folder as vault"** (or **"Open"**).
2. Navigate into your Minrock project directory and select the **`src/content`** folder.
3. Trust the author and enable community plugins when prompted.

The **Vault CMS Setup Wizard** modal will appear automatically on your screen.

> [!TIP]
> If you accidentally closed the wizard or want to re-run it later, press `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P` on macOS) and run the command: **"Vault CMS: Open Wizard"**.

---

## Step 3: Calibrating the Setup Wizard for Minrock

The default Vault CMS tutorial is built around general themes (like Axis), which often use flat Markdown files (`blog/post.md`) and generic property names. Minrock, however, uses an **Atomic Folder-Based Page Bundle** architecture and strict Zod schemas.

Here is the exact field-by-field mapping required for Minrock:

| Wizard Step | Setting Name | Minrock Value | Why This Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Welcome** | Setup Mode | **`Get started`** | Never select community presets (e.g. *Slate*, *Chiri*), as they overwrite Minrock's custom layout and styles. |
| **2. Detection** | Project Root | **`../..`** | Points 2 levels up from `src/content` to find your `package.json` and `astro.config.mjs`. |
| **2. Detection** | Extended Types | **Disabled** | Minrock uses standard Markdown and MDX; raw data files are not needed. |
| **3. Content Type**| Type Name | **`Blog`** | Matches your Astro content collection declared in `src/content.config.ts`. |
| **3. Content Type**| Folder | **`blog`** | Directory path inside `src/content/`. |
| **3. Content Type**| File Organization | **`folder` (*Folder-based*)** | Crucial: ensures every post is generated as `blog/<slug>/index.md`. |
| **3. Content Type**| Index File Name | **`index`** | Matches Astro's page bundle convention (`index.md`). |
| **3. Content Type**| Link Base Path | **`/blog/`** | The public URL prefix for reading posts. |
| **4. Frontmatter** | Title Property | **`title`** | The article's main heading. |
| **4. Frontmatter** | Date Property | **`pubDate`** | **Important:** Minrock uses `pubDate` (not `date`) formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| **4. Frontmatter** | Description | **`description`** | Concise meta summary used for SEO and OpenGraph cards. |
| **4. Frontmatter** | Tags Property | **`tags`** | List of tags for categorizing articles. |
| **4. Frontmatter** | Draft Property | **`draft`** | Logic: `true-draft` (marking `draft: true` hides the post in production). |
| **5. Attachments** | Handling Mode | **`Same folder as current file`** | Directs `Ctrl + V` pasted screenshots into the post's own folder. |
| **8. Deployment** | Target Platform | **`Vercel`** (or your host) | Prepares deployment hooks. |
| **9. Git Setup** | Git Integration | **Optional / SSH** | If your repo is already authenticated with Git, you can skip token input. |

## The Page Bundle Architecture Explained

Why does Minrock insist on the **Folder-Based (Page Bundle)** pattern over flat Markdown files?

│   ├── index.md             # The article text and frontmatter
│   ├── wizard-step-3.png    # Screenshot pasted via Ctrl + V

```

### 1. Seamless Inline Previews in Obsidian
When you write in Obsidian and insert an image via standard Markdown (`![Diagram](architecture.svg)`), Obsidian resolves files relative to the current note. 
If images were saved in an external `public/images/` directory outside the vault, Obsidian's live editor would display a broken image icon. With page bundles, the preview renders **instantaneously** both in Obsidian and on your live website.

### 2. Zero Orphaned Media Files
In long-running technical blogs, deleting an obsolete article often leaves dozens of forgotten screenshots cluttering `public/`. With page bundles, each article is completely self-contained. Deleting the article folder cleanly cleans up all associated images.

### 3. One-Click Paste Workflow (`Ctrl + V`)
To make sure Obsidian always places pasted screenshots right next to your note:
1. Open Obsidian **Settings** (`Ctrl + ,`).
2. Navigate to **Files and links** → **Default location for new attachments**.
3. Select **"Same folder as current file"** (or type `./` in the subfolder box).

## Frontmatter Template for New Posts

When you create a new note in Obsidian (or via `Ctrl + N` inside the Blog collection), the frontmatter will look like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title Here"
description: "A clear, compelling summary for readers and search engines."
pubDate: 2026-09-16
tags: ["engineering", "architecture"]
draft: false
---
```

When saved, Minrock's Astro engine automatically generates the clean route at `/blog/your-post-title-here/`.

---

## How to Update Community Plugins in Obsidian

A frequent question regarding pre-bundled vaults is: *“What if the plugins become outdated?”*

Upgrading community plugins in Obsidian never requires terminal commands or touching git submodules:

1. Open Obsidian **Settings** (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,`).
2. Click **Community plugins** in the left sidebar.
3. Click the **"Check for updates"** button at the top.
4. Click **"Update all"**.

Obsidian fetches the newest releases for Vault CMS, Astro Composer, and Obsidian Git in seconds while preserving all your calibrated configuration files (`data.json`).

---

## Publishing to the Web

Because Minrock is a pure **Static Site Generation (SSG)** engine, publishing is as simple as pushing your Git commits:

1. **Inside Obsidian (1-Click Automagic)**: Click the **Git Push / Up Arrow (`↑`)** icon in Obsidian's bottom status bar (or run `Ctrl + P` → `Git: Push`). Obsidian automatically drafts the commit message and pushes to GitHub without opening a terminal or typing any commands.
2. **Via Terminal**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: publish new technical article"
   git push origin main
   ```

Your hosting provider (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or GitHub Pages) detects the push, runs `npm run build`, and your article is live worldwide within seconds.

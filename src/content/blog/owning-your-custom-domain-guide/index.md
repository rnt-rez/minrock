When starting a personal blog or developer portfolio, one of the most common misconceptions is that maintaining a professional web address requires expensive monthly hosting fees or advanced DevOps skills.

In reality, the modern web has made digital independence more accessible than ever. With a modest one-time annual domain purchase (often as little as $8 to $12 per year) and free, high-performance static hosting platforms like **Vercel** or **Cloudflare Pages**, you can own an authoritative, globally distributed presence on the web with **zero ongoing server bills**.

## Why Buy Your Own Domain?

While platforms often provide free subdomains (like `username.vercel.app` or `username.github.io`), investing in your own domain name (such as `yourname.com`, `yourname.dev`, or `yourname.com.br`) transforms your presence from a temporary project into a permanent home:

1. **Digital Sovereignty**: You own your address. If you ever switch from Vercel to Cloudflare, Netlify, or AWS, your URL never changes and your visitors never lose you.
2. **Professional Credibility**: Sharing `yourname.com` on resumes, GitHub bios, and LinkedIn signals intention and personal craft.
3. **SEO & Link Equity**: Every backlink, citation, and article you write accumulates domain authority under your own brand for years to come.
4. **Custom Email**: Having a custom domain unlocks professional forwarding (e.g. `hello@yourname.com`).

## How Inexpensive Is It Really?

Many people assume a domain is a subscription service that costs dozens of dollars every month. In reality:

* **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Common extensions like `.com`, `.dev`, `.net`, or country-specific ones like `.com.br` typically cost between **$8 and $14 per year** (less than $1 a month).
* **Transparent Registrars**: Platforms like [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), or [Registro.br](https://registro.br) sell domains at wholesale cost with zero hidden markups and free WHOIS privacy protection.

## The Zero-Cost Hosting Revolution: Vercel & Cloudflare

Historically, having a custom domain meant paying $10 to $30 every month for shared Apache or cPanel hosting.

Today, static architecture themes like **Minrock** turn that model on its head:

| Capability | Old Hosting Model | Modern JAMstack / SSG |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Cost** | $10 – $35 / month | **$0.00 / month (Free Tier)** |
| **Global CDN** | Expensive add-on | **Included out of the box** |
| **SSL / HTTPS** | Paid certificates ($50/yr) | **Free, automated Let's Encrypt** |
| **Deployment** | Manual FTP uploads | **Automatic on `git push`** |
| **Downtime / Maintenance** | Database crashes & updates | **Zero servers to maintain** |

Because Minrock compiles into pure static HTML, CSS, and SVG files, platforms like **Vercel** and **Cloudflare Pages** can cache your entire website on edge servers in hundreds of cities around the world without incurring server compute charges.

## A High-Level Overview: How Connection Works

You don't need to be a network engineer to hook your custom domain up to your Minrock repository. The entire process consists of three straightforward steps:

### 1. Purchase Your Domain
Pick a clean, memorable name on a reputable registrar (e.g., Cloudflare Registrar or Porkbun).

### 2. Add Domain to Your Hosting Dashboard
In your **Vercel** or **Cloudflare Pages** project settings:
* Navigate to **Settings** → **Domains**.
* Type your domain name (e.g., `renatorezende.com` and `www.renatorezende.com`).

### 3. Point Your DNS Records
Your host will give you two simple DNS values:
* **CNAME Record**: Points `www` to your host's edge network (e.g. `cname.vercel-dns.com`).
* **A Record (or ALIAS)**: Points your root domain to the host's anycast IP addresses.

Once saved in your registrar's dashboard, the host automatically issues a free SSL certificate within minutes. Your website is now live worldwide under your own personal domain!
